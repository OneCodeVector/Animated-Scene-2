# Animated-Scene-2
Made by Samuel Andrews 4/14/2023 for a school project.  
All code is written by myself except for the p5 library. Every non-js file is also written by myself during the school day.
Click on the src folder to view the files. The sketch is all you need, but for better p5 performance, compile and execute the other scripts as modules.  
  
This project took 4 hours to complete, mainly due to the modules I made to speed up p5.
